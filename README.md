# prog-cms-tmpmky-scripts
little collection of tampermonkey plugins I've programmed for the prog1 cms

## Current Scripts

1. [Beautify Prog CMS](https://github.com/david-prv/prog-cms-tmpmky-scripts/blob/main/beautify_prog_cms.user.js) - Removes Closed and useless Opened Submissions to prevent unnecessary distractions
2. [DarkMode Prog CMS](https://github.com/david-prv/prog-cms-tmpmky-scripts/blob/main/darkmode_prog_cms.user.js) - Well, it makes the whole cms page... dark!

## Installation

1. Download Tampermonkey for your browser ([here](https://www.tampermonkey.net))
2. Enable Tampermonkey
3. Go to the Utilities tab
4. Download project files as ``.zip`` ([current version](https://github.com/david-prv/prog-cms-tmpmky-scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
5. Extract zip-file
6. Press "Select File" in tampermonkey (you can find it in "File" Section)
7. Now select the ``.js`` file, you've extracted from the zip-file and which you wish to install
8. Optional: Change constants if necessary (e.g ``YOUR_TIME_SLOT`` constant to your time slot)
9. Press install
10. You're done
