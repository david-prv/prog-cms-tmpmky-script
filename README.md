# prog-cms-tmpmky-scripts
little collection of tampermonkey plugins I've programmed for the prog1 cms

## Current Scripts

1. [Beautify Prog CMS (v2.4)](https://github.com/david-prv/prog-cms-tmpmky-scripts/blob/main/beautify_prog_cms.user.js) - Removes Closed Submissions
2. [Hide Sensitive Data (v0.1)](https://github.com/david-prv/prog-cms-tmpmky-scripts/blob/main/hide_sensitive_data.user.js) - Hide your sensitive data in all SIC-related Course-Management-Systems
3. [DarkMode Prog CMS (unfinished, development stopped)](https://github.com/david-prv/prog-cms-tmpmky-scripts/blob/main/darkmode_prog_cms.user.js) - Well, it makes the whole cms page... dark!  
(Since the development on this has stopped, I recommend [this](https://github.com/ColinTimBarndt/stylus_cms-sic-saarland-theme) stylus theme, made by [Colin Barndt](https://github.com/ColinTimBarndt))
